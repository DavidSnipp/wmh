    The Cater Room, previously known as the Committee Room.
    Terry Cater was the 8th Chairman of WMH from 2004-2018 as well as a Worplesdon Parish councillor for many years.
    Also as we know Terry’s history with all the hall and sport on the grounds must be second to none. 17 years a
    trustee/ chairman. Also his father was very heavily involved in both as well. Terry’s father was chair of Worplesdon
    Parish council during his years as a councillor from 1972-1973 then 1976-1985/6 until his death. Also the
    wicketkeeper for Fairlands cricket team. He was described by Surrey Advertiser as “the spirit of Worplesdon”
    something his son Terry has continued to do. During covid lockdown Terry volunteered to put new pictures
    up in the Sime Gallery no easy task for man of mature years. Terry has also been involved as Hon secretary of
    football club for 12 years and chairman of cricket club for 10 years and player of Worplesdon football and cricket
    clubs for 42 years and still watches matches . Also was Chairman of the committee responsible to the Worplesdon
    Parish council for the millennium book Worplesdon A Tale of Four Villages. He received Guildford Mayors award for
    community service. A families dedication to the well being of the Memorial hall and recreational grounds.
    As you can see both men 14 years chairman of WMH quite something. Obviously Sir Laurence Halsey the longest serving
    chairman. Harry his father was known as Mr Worplesdon, he was a member of the territorial army , he was one of the
    first to serve at Dunkirk and one of twenty in his unit to survive the Battle of Arnham. On his return to Worplesdon
